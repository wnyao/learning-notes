# What are the differences between sass and scss?

### SASS

- CSS pre-processor with syntax advancement.
- **Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets** and do not extend the css standard itself.
- Provides the features of **nested rules, inheritance, Mixins**.
- **Older syntax**, known as the indented syntax or (SASS).
- Uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties.
- Files using this syntax have the `.sass` extension.

### SCSS

- **Sassy Cascaded Style Sheets** (Sassy CSS)
- Is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This mean that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning.
- File using this syntax has `.scss` extension.
- Similar to that of CSS and **fills the gaps and incompatibilities between CSS and SASS**.
