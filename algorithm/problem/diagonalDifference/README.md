# Diagonal Difference

Given a square matrix of size , calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its
diagonals.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, . The next lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line
containing space-separated integers describing the columns.

## Constraints

- -100 <= Elements in the matrix <= 100

## Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

## Sample Input

```
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
```

## Sample Output

```
15
```

## Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

```
11
    5
        -12
```

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4
The secondary diagonal is:

```
        4
    5
10
```

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

Note: |x| is absolute value function
