### Question

```
var primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];
```

Suppose we want to know whether the number 67 is prime. If 67 is in the array, then it's prime.
We might also want to know how many primes are smaller than 67. If we find the position of the number 67 in the array, we can use that to figure out how many smaller primes exist.
