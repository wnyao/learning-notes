# Binary Heap

- One of more efficient methods of searching.
- Rely on tree like structure to hold keys used to access data elements.

### Performance

A binary heap tends to work best in dynamic situations in which keys change regulary. The binary heap also offers advantages:

- Creating the required structures requires fewer resources because binary heaps rely on arrays, make them cache friendlier as well.
- Building a binary heap requires `O(n)` time, contrasted to BST, which requires `O(n log n)` time.
- Using pointers to implement the tree isn't necessary.
- Relying on binary heap variations (i.e. Fibonacci Heap) offers advantages such as increase and decrease key times of `O(1)` time.
