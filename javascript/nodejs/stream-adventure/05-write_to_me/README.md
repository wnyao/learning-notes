## WRITE TO ME (Exercise 5 of 17)

## Writable Streams

To create a custom Writable stream you must call the new stream.Writable(options) constructor and implement the `_write()` and/or `_writev()` method

```js
const { Writable } = require('stream')

const myWritable = new Writable({
 write(chunk, encoding, callback) {}
})
```

or

```js
const { Writable } = require('stream')

class MyCustomWritable extends Writable {
 _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
   // ...
 }
}
```

### _write method

The _write method is used to send data to the underlying resource. This method MUST NOT be called by your application code directly. Instead it's called by internal Writable class methods only.

The method receive the following arguments:

- chunk is the value to be written, commonly a Buffer converted from the string you passed to stream.write().
- encoding, if the chunk is a string, will be the character encoding for the string. Otherwise it may be ignored.
- callback function that will be called when the processing for the supplied chunk is complete.

The callback function receive one argument, this argument must be an Error
object if the write process fail or null if succeeded.

### Using a Writable stream

To write data to a writable stream you need to call the write() method on the stream instance.

```js
readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
 writable.write(chunk)
})
```

Also you can use the pipe method, that we'd learned before.

### Challenge

Implement a writable stream that writes in console `writing:` + the given chunk And pipe it to process.stdin
