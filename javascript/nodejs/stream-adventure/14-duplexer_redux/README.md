## DUPLEXER REDUX (Exercise 14 of 17)

In this example, you will be given a readable stream, counter, as the first argument to your exported function:

```js
module.exports = function (counter) {
 // return a duplex stream to count countries on the writable side
 // and pass through `counter` on the readable side
}
```

Return a duplex stream with the counter as the readable side. You will be written objects with a 2-character country field as input, such as these:

```js
{"short":"OH","name":"Ohio","country":"US"}
{"name":"West Lothian","country":"GB","region":"Scotland"}
{"short":"NSW","name":"New South Wales","country":"AU"}
```

Create an object to track the number of occurrences of each unique country code.

For example:

```js
{"US": 2, "GB": 3, "CN": 1}
```

Once the input ends, call counter.setCounts() with your counts object.

The duplexer2 module will again be very handy in this example.

If you use duplexer, make sure to npm install duplexer2 in the directory where your solution file is located.

Keep in mind that you will have to work with objects, not buffers. Consult the documentation for further details:
(https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode)

When you switch on the object mode, remember to do the same for all additional dependencies that you work with (i.e. through2)
