## MEET PIPE (Exercise 2 of 17)

## What are streams?

A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.

That means you can consume data as it is loaded or produced, chunk by chunk (or piece by piece), instead of getting it all into memory to start consuming it.

Streams can be readable, writable, or both.

There are four types of streams:

- Readable stream, which data can be read.
- Writable stream, which data can be written.
- Duplex stream, which is both Readable and Writable.
- Transform stream, which is a Duplex stream that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read.

Streams are present in many Node.js modules, for example `http.request()`, `zlib.createGzip()`, `fs.createReadStream()`, `process.stdout` ... all of these return streams.

## The pipe method

The pipe method allows you to connect the output of the readable stream as
the input of the writable stream

```js
readable.pipe(writable)
```

If you pipe into a duplex stream you can chain to other stream.

```js
readable.pipe(duplex).pipe(writable)
```

## Challenge

You will get a file as the first argument to your program (process.argv[2]).
 
Use fs.createReadStream() to pipe the given file to process.stdout.

`fs.createReadStream()` takes a file as an argument and returns a readable stream that you can call `.pipe()` on. Here's a readable stream that pipes its data to `process.stderr`:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
fs.createReadStream('data.txt').pipe(process.stderr)
```

Your program is basically the same idea, but instead of 'data.txt', the filename comes from process.argv[2] and you should pipe to stdout, not stderr.
