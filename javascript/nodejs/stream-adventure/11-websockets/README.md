## WEBSOCKETS (Exercise 11 of 17)

In this adventure, write a websocket client that uses the ws module, generate a stream on top of the websocket client, write the string "hello\n" to the stream and pipe it to process.stdout.

To open a stream with ws on localhost:8099, just write:

```js
const WebSocket = require('ws')
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8099')
const stream = WebSocket.createWebSocketStream(ws)
```

The readme for ws has more info if you're curious about how to write the server side code: (https://github.com/websockets/ws)

Make sure to npm install ws in the directory where your solution file lives.
