## SECRETZ (Exercise 17 of 17)

An encrypted, gzipped tar file will be piped in on process.stdin. To beat this challenge, for each file in the tar input, print a hex-encoded md5 hash of the file contents followed by a single space followed by the file path, then a newline.

You will receive the cipher algorithm name as process.argv[2], the cipher key as process.argv[3] and the cipher initialization vector as process.argv[4]. You can pass these arguments directly through to crypto.createDecipheriv().

The tar module from npm has a tar.Parse() constructor that can unzip gzipped tar files automatically ( if detected ) and  emits entry events for each file in the tar input.

Each entry object is a readable stream of the file contents from the archive and:

   `entry.type` is the kind of file ('File', 'Directory', etc)
   `entry.path` is the file path

Using the tar module looks like:

```js
const tar = require('tar')
const parser = new tar.Parse()

parser.on('entry', function (e) {
   console.dir(e)
});

const fs = require('fs')
fs.createReadStream('file.tar').pipe(parser)
```

Use crypto.createHash('md5', { encoding: 'hex' }) to generate a stream that outputs a hex md5 hash for the content written to it.

The concat-stream module could be useful to concatenate all stream data.

Make sure to run npm install tar concat-stream in the directory where your solution file lives.
