## CRYPT (Exercise 16 of 17)

Your program will be given a passphrase on process.argv[2], an
initialization value on process.argv[3] and 'aes256' encrypted data will
be written to stdin.

Simply decrypt the data and stream the result to process.stdout.

You can use the crypto.createDecipheriv() api from node core to solve this
challenge. Here's an example:

```js
const crypto = require('crypto')
const stream = crypto.createDecipher('RC4', 'robots')
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
stream.write(Buffer([ 135, 197, 164, 92, 129, 90, 215, 63, 92 ]))
stream.end()
```

Instead of calling .write() yourself, just pipe stdin into your decrypter.
