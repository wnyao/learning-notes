## HTTP SERVER (Exercise 9 of 17)

In this challenge, write an http server that uses a through stream to write back the request stream as upper-cased response data for POST requests.

Streams aren't just for text files and stdin/stdout. Did you know that http request and response objects from node core's http.createServer() handler are also streams?

For example, we can stream a file to the response object:

```js
const http = require('http')
const fs = require('fs')

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
 fs.createReadStream('file.txt').pipe(res)
});

server.listen(process.argv[2])
```

This is great because our server can respond immediately without buffering everything in memory first.

We can also stream a request to populate a file with data:

```js
const http = require('http')
const fs = require('fs')

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
 if (req.method === 'POST') {
   req.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('post.txt'))
 }
 res.end('beep boop\n')
});

server.listen(process.argv[2])
```

You can test this post server with curl:

```js
$ node server.js 8000 &
$ echo hack the planet | curl -d@- http://localhost:8000
beep boop
$ cat post.txt
hack the planet
```

Your http server should listen on the port given at process.argv[2] and convert the POST request written to it to upper-case using the same approach as the TRANSFORM example.

As a refresher, here's an example with the default through2 callbacks explicitly defined:

```js
 const through = require('through2');
 process.stdin.pipe(through(write, end)).pipe(process.stdout);

 function write (buf, _, next) {
   this.push(buf);
   next();
 }

 function end (done) { done(); }
 ```

Do that, but send upper-case data in your http server in response to POST data.

Make sure to npm install through2 in the directory where your solution file lives.
