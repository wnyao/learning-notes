## CONCAT (Exercise 8 of 17)

Create a new file called concat.js.

You will be given text on process.stdin, convert buffer to string and reverse it using the concat-stream module before writing it to process.stdout.

concat-stream is a writable stream that concatenate all buffers from a stream and give you the result in the callback you pass like parameter.

Here's an example that uses concat-stream to buffer POST content in order to JSON.parse() the submitted data:

```js
const concat = require('concat-stream')
const http = require('http')

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
 if (req.method === 'POST') {
   req.pipe(concat(function (body) {
     const obj = JSON.parse(body)
     res.end(Object.keys(obj).join('\n'))
   }));
 } else res.end()
});

server.listen(5000)
```

In your adventure you'll only need to buffer input with concat() from process.stdin.

Make sure to npm install concat-stream in the directory where your solution file is located.

## Hint:

Both process.stdout and concat-stream are writeable streams, so they can't
be piped together.
