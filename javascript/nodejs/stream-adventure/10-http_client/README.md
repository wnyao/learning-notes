 ## HTTP CLIENT (Exercise 10 of 17)

Send an HTTP POST request to (http://localhost:8099) and pipe
process.stdin into it. Pipe the response stream to process.stdout.

You can use the http module in node core, specifically the request method,
to solve this challenge.

Here's an example to make a POST request using http.request():

```js
const { request } = require('http')

const options = { method: 'POST' }
const req = request('http://beep.boop:80/', options, (res) => {
 /* Do something with res*/
})
```

Hint: The req object that you get back from request() is a writable stream
and the res object in the callback function is a readable stream.
