## READ IT (Exercise 4 of 17)

## Implementing a Readable Stream

To implement a Readable stream, you need to construct an object, or inherit, from stream.Readable class and implement a _read() method in it.

```js
const { Readable } = require('stream')

const myStream = new Readable({})
myStream._read = () => {}
```

or

```js
const { Readable } = require('stream')

class MyStream extends Readable {
 _read() {}
}
```

Note: This _read method MUST NOT be called by application code directly. It should be called by the internal Readable class methods only.

### Reading modes

Readable streams operate in one of two modes: flowing and paused.

- In flowing mode, data is read from the underlying system automatically and provided as quickly as possible.
- In paused mode, the read() method must be called explicitly to read chunks of data from the stream.

All Readable streams begin in paused mode but can be switched to flowing
mode and also can be switched back to paused mode.

### Consuming a Readable Stream

- `readable.pipe(writable)`, attaching Writable stream to the readable, cause it to switch automatically into flowing mode and push all of its data to the attached Writable.
- `readable.on('readable', ...)`, here the stream (readable) is in paused mode and have to use the read(size) method for start consuming the data.
- `readable.on('data', ...)`, adding the data event handler switch the stream to a flowing mode. We can pause and resume the stream by using pause() and resume() methods respectively. This is useful when you need to do some time-consuming action with the stream's data (such as writing to a database)

### Adding data to stream

You can use the push() method to add content into the readable internal Buffer.

### Challenge

Implement a Readable stream, initiate a new stream instance from your implementation and pipe to process.stdout. You will receive the content to add to your stream as the first argument to your program (process.argv[2]).
