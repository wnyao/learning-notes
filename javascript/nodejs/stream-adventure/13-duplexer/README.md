## DUPLEXER (Exercise 13 of 17)

Write a program that exports a function that spawns a process from a cmd
string and an args array and returns a single duplex stream joining
together the stdin and stdout of the spawned process:

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process')

module.exports = function (cmd, args) {
 // spawn the process and return a single stream
 // joining together the stdin and stdout here
}
```

There is a very handy module you can use here: duplexer2. The duplexer2
module exports a single function duplexer2(writable, readable) that joins
together a writable stream and a readable stream into a single,
readable/writable duplex stream.

If you use duplexer2, make sure to npm install duplexer2 in the directory
where your solution file is located.

Keep in mind that the main and child processes will have different stream
interface.

process.stdin is a Readable stream
process.stdout is a Writable stream

For process you're inside the process to stdin is readable to you. For
child process you're outside so that process's stdin is writable to you.

childProc.stdin is a Writable stream
childProc.stdout is a Readable stream

Also, have a look at the duplexer2 documentation and notice that
singnature of the exported function is duplexer2([options], writable,
readable) which means that you might need to pass an options argument.

Create a new file called duplexer.js which will hold your solution.
