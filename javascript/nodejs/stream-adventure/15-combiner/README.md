## COMBINER (Exercise 15 of 17)

Create a module in a new file named combiner.js, it should return a
readable/writable stream using the stream-combiner module.

You can use this code to start with:

```js
const combine = require('stream-combiner')

module.exports = function () {
 return combine(
   // read newline-separated json,
   // group books into genres,
   // then gzip the output
 )
}
```

Your stream will be written a newline-separated JSON list of science
fiction genres and books. All the books after a "type":"genre" row belong
in that genre until the next "type":"genre" comes along in the output.

```sh
{"type":"genre","name":"cyberpunk"}
{"type":"book","name":"Neuromancer"}
{"type":"book","name":"Snow Crash"}
{"type":"genre","name":"space opera"}
{"type":"book","name":"A Deepness in the Sky"}
{"type":"book","name":"Void"}
```

Your program should generate a newline-separated list of JSON lines of
genres, each with a "books" array containing all the books in that genre.
The input above would yield the output:

```sh
{"name":"cyberpunk","books":["Neuromancer","Snow Crash"]}
{"name":"space opera","books":["A Deepness in the Sky","Void"]}
```

Your stream should take this list of JSON lines and gzip it with
zlib.createGzip().

##  HINTS

The stream-combiner module creates a pipeline from a list of streams,
returning a single stream that exposes the first stream as the writable
side and the last stream as the readable side like the duplexer module,
but with an arbitrary number of streams in between. Unlike the duplexer
module, each stream is piped to the next. For example:

```js
const combine = require('stream-combiner')
const stream = combine(a, b, c, d)
```

will internally do a.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d) but the stream returned by
combine() has its writable side hooked into a and its readable side hooked
into d.

Your module should return the combined stream that will be fed input into
the front 'end' of the stream, reads the associated JSON, processes the
input book data by grouping it by genre and produces a gzipped result
stream from which the result may be read.

As in the previous LINES adventure, the split2 module is very handy here.
You can put a split2 stream directly into the stream-combiner pipeline.
Note that split2 can send empty lines too.

If you end up using split2 and stream-combiner, make sure to install them
into the directory where your solution file resides by doing:

```sh
$ npm install stream-combiner split2
```

To verify your solution run: stream-adventure verify combiner.js
