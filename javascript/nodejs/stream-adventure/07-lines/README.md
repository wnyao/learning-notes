## LINES (Exercise 7 of 17)

Instead of transforming every line as in the previous "TRANSFORM" example, for this challenge, convert even-numbered lines to upper-case and odd-numbered lines to lower-case. Consider the first line to be odd-numbered. For example given this input:

```sh
One
Two
Three
Four
```

Your program should output:

```sh
one
TWO
three
FOUR
```

Even though it's not obligatory, you can use the split2 module to split input by newlines. For example:

```js
const split2 = require('split2')
const through2 = require('through2')
process.stdin
 .pipe(split2())
 .pipe(through2(function (line, _, next) {
     console.dir(line.toString())
     next();
 }))
 ```

split2 will buffer chunks on newlines before you get them. With example above, we will get separate events for each line even though all the data probably arrives on the same chunk:

```js
$ echo -e 'one\ntwo\nthree' | node split.js
'one'
'two'
'three'
```

Your own program could use split2 in this way, and you should transform the input and pipe the output through to process.stdout.

You are free to solve the challenge without split2 module. In this case, you would have to add a new line after each line to have a passing match.

Make sure to npm install split2 through2 in the directory where your solution file lives.
